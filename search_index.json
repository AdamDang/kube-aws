\nkube-aws is a command-line tool to create/update/destroy Kubernetes clusters on AWS. The full manual can be found here.\nTo start using kube-aws, try the Getting Started Guide.\nOnce you are familiar with the basic setup, the sections Add-Ons and some Advanced Topics cover additional setup, use cases and configuration.\n  \nFeatures \n\nCreate, update and destroy Kubernetes clusters on AWS\nHighly available and scalable Kubernetes clusters backed by multi-AZ deployment and Node Pools\nDeployment to an existing VPC\nPowered by various AWS services including CloudFormation, KMS, Auto Scaling, Spot Fleet, EC2, ELB, S3, etc\n\nKubernetes Incubator\nkube-aws is a Kubernetes Incubator project. The project was established 2017-03-15. The incubator team for the project is:\n\nSponsor: Tim Hockin (@thockin)\nChampion: Mike Danese (@mikedanese)\nSIG: sig-aws\n\nAnnouncements\nOlder releases of kube-aws had been signed by the CoreOS key and were verifiable with the CoreOS Application Signing Public Key. This was when kube-aws was maintained primarily by CoreOS. However, the signing process has been postponed since v0.9.3 since the comm. Please read the issue #288 for more information.\nDocumentation Updates\nPlease contact us if you wish to see a topic added to the manual.\n"},"tutorials/quick-start.html":{"url":"tutorials/quick-start.html","title":"Quick Start","keywords":"","body":"Quick Start\nGet started with kube-aws and deploy a fully-functional Kubernetes cluster running on CoreOS Container Linux using AWS CloudFormation.\nAfter completing this guide, you will be able to deploy applications to Kubernetes on AWS and interact with the Kubernetes API using the kubectl CLI tool.\nPre-requisites\nPrior to using setting up your first Kubernetes cluster using kube-aws, you will need to setup the following. More details on each pre-requisite are available in the rest of the documentation.\n\nInstall and Configure the AWS CLI\nInstall and Set Up kubectl which is the CLI for controlling a Kubernetes cluster\nCreate an EC2 Key Pair in your chosen AWS region and record the name of the key for step 2 in this guide\nHave a Route 53 hosted zone ready to expose the Kubernetes API and record the hosted zone ID and domain name for step 2 in this guide\nCreate a KMS Key in your chosen AWS region and record the ARN for step 2 in this guide\nCreate an S3 Bucket to store kube-aws assets and record the bucket name for step 2 and 3 in this guide\n\nStep 1: Download kube-aws\nGo to the releases and download the latest release tarball for your architecture. Extract the binary and add kube-aws to your path:\n➜ tar zxvf kube-aws-${PLATFORM}.tar.gz\n➜ sudo mv ${PLATFORM}/kube-aws /usr/local/bin\n➜ kube-aws --help\n\nStep 2: Render\nFirst run init using the information from the pre-requisites section. For example:\n➜ kube-aws init \\\n  --cluster-name=quick-start-k8 \\\n  --region=us-west-1 \\\n  --availability-zone=us-west-1a \\\n  --hosted-zone-id=ZBN159WIK8JJD \\\n  --external-dns-name=quick-start-k8s.mycompany.com \\\n  --key-name=ec2-key-pair-name \\\n  --kms-key-arn=\"arn:aws:kms:us-west-1:123456789012:key/c4f79cb0-f9fb-434a-ac3c-47c5697d51e6\"\n  --s3-uri=s3://kube-aws-assets/\n\nThis will generate a cluster.yaml file which forms the main configuration for your new cluster. The cluster.yaml has many options to adjust your cluster, leave them as the defaults for now.\nNext use render credentials to generate new credentials for your cluster into the credentials directory:\n➜ kube-aws render credentials --generate-ca\n\nThe files generated are TLS assets which allow communication between nodes and also allow super admins to administer the cluster. After the quick start you may wish to use your own CA assets.\nNext use render stack to generate the CloudFormation stack templates and user data into the stack-templates and userdata directories:\n➜ kube-aws render stack\n\nThe files generated form the basis of the deployment.\nBefore we move onto deploying, let's run validate to check the work above using the S3 bucket name from the pre-requisites section. For example:\n➜ kube-aws validate\n\nStep 3: Launch\nNow you've generated and validated the various assets needed to launch a new cluster, let's run the deploy! Run up using the S3 bucket name from the pre-requisites section. For example:\n➜ kube-aws up\n\nStep 4: Deploy an Application\nLet's deploy our first application to the new cluster, nginx is easy to start with:\n➜ export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/kubeconfig\n➜ kubectl run quick-start-nginx --image=nginx --port=80\ndeployment \"quick-start-nginx\" created\n\n➜ kubectl get pods\nNAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nquick-start-nginx-6687bdfc67-6qsr8   1/1       Running   0          10s\n\nYou can see above the pod is running and ready. To try it out we can forward a local port to the pod:\n➜ kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods -l \"run=quick-start-nginx\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\") 8080:80  \nForwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 80\n\nThen load the nginx home page in a browser:\n➜ open http://localhost:8080/\n\nYou should see a Welcome to nginx! page.\nIf you'd like to try exposing a public load balancer, first run:\n➜ kubectl expose deployment quick-start-nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer\n\nWait a few seconds for Kubernetes to create an AWS ELB to to expose the service and then run:\n➜ open http://$(kubectl get svc quick-start-nginx -o jsonpath=\"{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}\")\n\nYou should see the same Welcome to nginx! page as above.\nThe above commands demonstrate some basic kubectl imperative commands to create a Kubernetes Deployment and Service object. Declarative object configuration is also available, for more information see Kubernetes Object Management.\nStep 5: Tear Down\nOnce you no longer need the quick start cluster created during this guide, tear it down:\n➜ kubectl delete svc quick-start-nginx\nservice \"quick-start-nginx\" deleted\n\n➜ kube-aws destroy\n\nThe first command deletes the Service object created in step 4 so the AWS ELB is removed otherwise the network interface attachments may block the CloudFormation stack from being deleted.\n"},"getting-started/":{"url":"getting-started/","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nDeploy a fully-functional Kubernetes cluster using AWS CloudFormation.

Before we launch our cluster, let's define a few parameters that the cluster requires.\nCluster parameters\nEC2 key pair\nThe keypair that will authenticate SSH access to your EC2 instances. The public half of this key pair will be configured on each CoreOS node.\nAfter creating a key pair, you will use the name you gave the keys to configure the cluster. Key pairs are only available to EC2 instances in the same region. More info in the EC2 Keypair docs.\nKMS key\nAmazon KMS keys are used to encrypt and decrypt cluster TLS assets. If you already have a KMS Key that you would like to use, you can skip creating a new key and provide the Arn string for your existing key.\nYou can create a KMS key in the AWS console, or with the aws command line tool:\n$ aws kms --region= create-key --description=\"kube-aws assets\"\n{\n    \"KeyMetadata\": {\n        \"CreationDate\": 1458235139.724,\n        \"KeyState\": \"Enabled\",\n        \"Arn\": \"arn:aws:kms:us-west-1:xxxxxxxxx:key/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n        \"AWSAccountId\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n        \"Enabled\": true,\n        \"KeyUsage\": \"ENCRYPT_DECRYPT\",\n        \"KeyId\": \"xxxxxxxxx\",\n        \"Description\": \"kube-aws assets\"\n    }\n}\n\nYou will use the KeyMetadata.Arn string to identify your KMS key in the init step.\nExternal DNS name\nSelect a DNS hostname where the cluster API will be accessible. Typically this hostname is available over the internet (\"external\"), so end users can connect from different networks. This hostname will be used to provision the TLS certificate for the API server, which encrypts traffic between your users and the API. Optionally, you can provide the certificates yourself, which is recommended for production clusters.\nWhen the cluster is created, the cluster will expose the TLS-secured API on an internet-facing ELB. kube-aws can automatically create an ALIAS record for the ELB in an existing Route 53 hosted zone specified via the --hosted-zone-id flag. If you have a DNS zone hosted in Route 53, you can configure for it below.\nYou can also omit --hosted-zone-id by specifying the --no-record-set flag. However, then, you will need to create an Route53 ALIAS record or a CNAME record for the external DNS hostname you want to point to this ELB. You can find the public DNS name of the ELB after the cluster is created by invoking kube-aws status.\nS3 bucket\nAmazon S3 buckets are used to transfer large stack templates generated by kube-aws to CloudFormation. If you already have a S3 bucket that you would like to use, you can skip creating a new bucket and provide the URI for your existing bucket.\nYou can create a S3 bucket in the AWS console, or with the aws command line tool.\nThe command varies among AWS regions.\nFor the us-east-1 region:\n$ aws s3api --region=us-east-1 create-bucket --bucket \n{\n    \"Location\": \"/\"\n}\n\nFor other regions:\n$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-bucket --region eu-west-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=eu-west-1\n\nInitialize an asset directory\nCreate a directory on your local machine to hold the generated assets:\n$ mkdir my-cluster\n$ cd my-cluster\n\nInitialize the cluster CloudFormation stack with the KMS Arn, key pair name, and DNS name from the previous step:\n$ kube-aws init \\\n--cluster-name=my-cluster-name \\\n--external-dns-name=my-cluster-endpoint \\\n--hosted-zone-id=hosted-zone-xxxxx \\\n--region=us-west-1 \\\n--availability-zone=us-west-1c \\\n--key-name=key-pair-name \\\n--kms-key-arn=\"arn:aws:kms:us-west-1:xxxxxxxxxx:key/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n--s3-uri=s3://my-kube-aws-assets-bucket\n\nHere us-west-1c is used for parameter --availability-zone, but supported availability zone varies among AWS accounts.\nPlease check if us-west-1c is supported by aws ec2 --region us-west-1 describe-availability-zones, if not switch to other supported availability zone. (e.g., us-west-1a, or us-west-1b)\nThere will now be a cluster.yaml file in the asset directory. This is the main configuration file for your cluster.\nRender contents of the asset directory\nTLS certificates\n\nIn the simplest case, you can have kube-aws generate both your TLS identities and certificate authority for you.\n$ kube-aws render credentials --generate-ca\n\nThis is not recommended for production, but is fine for development or testing purposes.\n\nIt is recommended that you supply your own immediate certificate signing authority and let kube-aws take care of generating the cluster TLS credentials.\n$ kube-aws render credentials --ca-cert-path=/path/to/ca-cert.pem --ca-key-path=/path/to/ca-key.pem\n\nIf the CA key is encrypted (which it should), you will be prompted for the key passphrase. Although not recommended, KUBE_AWS_CA_KEY_PASSPHRASE environment variable can be set to automate this process.\nFor more information on operating your own CA, check out this awesome guide.\n\nIn certain cases, such as users with advanced pre-existing PKI infrastructure, the operator may wish to pre-generate all cluster TLS assets. In this case, you can run kube-aws render stack and copy in your TLS assets into the credentials/ folder before running kube-aws up.\n\nls -R credentials/\nadmin-key.pem       apiserver-key.pem   ca-key.pem          etcd-client-key.pem etcd-key.pem        worker-key.pem\nadmin.pem           apiserver.pem       ca.pem              etcd-client.pem     etcd.pem            worker.pem\n\n\n\nRender cluster assets\nThe next command generates the default set of cluster assets in your asset directory.\n  $ kube-aws render stack\n\nHere's what the directory structure looks like:\n$ tree\n.\n├── cluster.yaml\n├── credentials\n│   ├── admin-key.pem\n│   ├── admin.pem\n│   ├── apiserver-key.pem\n│   ├── apiserver.pem\n│   ├── ca-key.pem\n│   ├── ca.pem\n│   ├── worker-key.pem\n│   └── worker.pem\n│   ├── etcd-key.pem\n│   └── etcd.pem\n│   ├── etcd-client-key.pem\n│   └── etcd-client.pem\n├── kubeconfig\n├── stack-template.json\n└── userdata\n    ├── cloud-config-controller\n    └── cloud-config-worker\n\nThese assets (templates and credentials) are used to create, update and interact with your Kubernetes cluster.\nAt this point you should be ready to create your cluster. You can also now check the my-cluster asset directory into version control if you desire. The contents of this directory are your reproducible cluster assets. Please take care not to commit the my-cluster/credentials directory but rather to encrypt and/or put it to more secure storage, as it contains your TLS secrets and access tokens. If you're using git, the credentials directory will already be ignored for you.\nPRODUCTION NOTE: the TLS keys and certificates generated by kube-aws should not be used to deploy a production Kubernetes cluster.\nEach component certificate is only valid for 90 days, while the CA is valid for 365 days.\nIf deploying a production Kubernetes cluster, consider establishing PKI independently of this tool first. Read more below.\nDid everything render correctly?\nIf you are familiar with CoreOS and the AWS platform, you may want to include some additional customizations or optional features. Read on below to explore more.\nYes, ready to launch the cluster\nView optional features & customizations below\nCustomizations to your cluster\nYou can now customize your cluster by editing asset files. Any changes to these files will require a render and validate workflow, covered below.\nCustomize infrastructure\n\ncluster.yaml\nThis is the configuration file for your cluster. It contains the configuration parameters that are templated into your userdata and CloudFormation stack.\nSome common customizations are:\n\nchange the number of workers\nspecify tags applied to all created resources\ncreate cluster inside an existing VPC\nchange controller and worker volume sizes\n\n\n\nuserdata/\n\ncloud-config-worker\ncloud-config-controller\n\nThis directory contains the cloud-init cloud-config userdata files. The CoreOS operating system supports automated provisioning via cloud-config files, which describe the various files, scripts and systemd actions necessary to produce a working cluster machine. These files are templated with your cluster configuration parameters and embedded into the CloudFormation stack template.\nSome common customizations are:\n\nmounting ephemeral disks\nallow pods to mount RDB or iSCSI volumes\nallowing access to insecure container registries\nuse host DNS configuration instead of a public DNS server\nchanging your CoreOS auto-update settings\n\n\n\nstack-template.json\nThis file describes the AWS CloudFormation stack which encompasses all the AWS resources associated with your cluster. This JSON document is templated with configuration parameters, we well as the encoded userdata files.\nSome common customizations are:\n\ntweak AutoScaling rules and timing\ninstance IAM roles\ncustomize security groups beyond the initial configuration\n\n\n\ncredentials/\nThis directory contains both encryped and unencrypted TLS assets for your cluster, along with a pre-configured kubeconfig file which provides access to your cluster api via kubectl.\nYou can also specify additional access tokens in tokens.csv as shown in the official docs.\n\n\nKubernetes Container Runtime\nThe kube-aws tool now optionally supports using rkt as the kubernetes container runtime. To configure rkt as the container runtime you must run with a CoreOS version >= v1151.0.0 and configure the runtime flag.\nEdit the cluster.yaml file:\ncontainerRuntime: rkt\nreleaseChannel: stable\n\nNote that while using rkt as the runtime is now supported, it is still a new option as of the Kubernetes v1.4 release and has a few known issues.\nCalico network policy\nThe cluster can be optionally configured to use Calico to provide network policy. These policies limit and control how different pods, namespaces, etc can communicate with each other. These rules can be managed after the cluster is launched, but the feature needs to be turned on beforehand.\nEdit the cluster.yaml file:\nuseCalico: true\n\nRoute53 Host Record\nkube-aws can create an ALIAS record for the controller's ELB in an existing Route53 hosted zone.\nJust run kube-aws init with the flag --hosted-zone-id to specify the id of the hosted zone in which the record is created.\nIf you've run kube-aws init without the flag but with --no-record-set, edit the cluster.yaml file to add loadBalancer.hostedZone.id under the first item of apiEndpoints while setting recordSetManaged to true or removing it:\napiEndpoints:\n- name: default\n  dNSName: kubernetes.staging.example.com\n  loadBalancer:\n    hostedZone:\n      id: A12B3CDE4FG5HI\n\n# DEPRECATED: use hostedZoneId instead\n#hostedZone: staging.example.com\n\n# DEPRECATED: use loadBalancer.hostedZone.id instead\n#hostedZoneId: A12B3CDE4FG5HI\n\n# DEPRECATED: use loadBalancer.createRecordSet instead\n# This is even implied to be true when loadBalancer.hostedZone.id is specified\n#createRecordSet: true\n\nIf createRecordSet is not set to true, the deployer will be responsible for making externalDNSName routable to the the ELB managing the controller nodes after the cluster is created.\nMulti-AZ Clusters\nKube-aws supports \"spreading\" a cluster across any number of Availability Zones in a given region.\nA word of caution about EBS and Persistent Volumes: Any pods deployed to a Multi-AZ cluster must mount EBS volumes via Persistent Volume Claims. Specifying the ID of the EBS volume directly in the pod spec will not work consistently if nodes are spread across multiple zones.\nRead more about Kubernetes Multi-AZ cluster support here.\nA common pitfall when deploying multi-AZ clusters in combination with cluster-autoscaler\ncluster-autoscaler is a tool that automatically adjusts the number of Kubernetes worker nodes when:\n\n\nthere is a pod that doesn’t have enough space to run in the cluster\nsome nodes in the cluster are so underutilized, for an extended period of time, that they can be deleted and their pods will be easily placed on some other, existing nodes.\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler\n\n\nA common pitfall in deploying cluster-autoscaler to a multi-AZ cluster is that you have to instruct an Auto Scaling Group not to spread over multiple availability zones or cluster-autoscaler results in instability while scaling out the nodes i.e. it takes unnecessary much time to finally bring up a node in the insufficient zone.\n\nThe autoscaling group should span 1 availability zone for the cluster autoscaler to work. If you want to distribute workloads evenly across zones, set up multiple ASGs, with a cluster autoscaler for each ASG. At the time of writing this, cluster autoscaler is unaware of availability zones and although autoscaling groups can contain instances in multiple availability zones when configured so, the cluster autoscaler can't reliably add nodes to desired zones. That's because AWS AutoScaling determines which zone to add nodes which is out of the control of the cluster autoscaler. For more information, see https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/1552#discussion_r75533090.\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/aws#deployment-specification\n\nPlease read the following guides carefully and select the appropriate deployment according to your requirement regarding auto-scaling.\nFor production cluster not requiring cluster-autoscaler\nIf you don't need auto-scaling at all, or you need only the AWS-native auto-scaling i.e. the a combination of auto scaling groups, scaling policies, CloudWatch alarms,\ntheoretically, you can safely go this way.\nEdit the cluster.yaml file to define multiple subnets, each with a different availability zone hence multi-AZ:\n subnets:\n   - availabilityZone: us-west-1a\n     instanceCIDR: \"10.0.0.0/24\"\n   - availabilityZone: us-west-1b\n     instanceCIDR: \"10.0.1.0/24\"\n\nThis implies that you rely on AWS AutoScaling for selecting which subnet hence which availability zone to add a node when an auto-scaling group's DesiredCapacity is increased.\nPlease read the AWS documentation for more details about AWS Auto Scaling.\nFor production cluster requiring cluster-autoscaler\nYou must utilize an experimental feature called Node Pool to achieve this deployment.\nPlease read the documentation for experimental features for more instructions.\nCertificates and Keys\nkube-aws render begins by initializing the TLS infrastructure needed to securely operate Kubernetes. If you have your own key/certificate management system, you can overwrite the generated TLS assets after kube-aws render. More information on Kubernetes certificate generation.\nWhen kube-aws up creates the cluster stack, it will use whatever TLS assets it finds in the credentials folder at the time.\nThis includes the certificate authority, signed server certificates for the Kubernetes API server and workers, and a signed client certificate for administrative use.\n\nAPIServerCert, APIServerKey\nThe API server certificate will be valid for the value of externalDNSName, as well as a the DNS names used to route Kubernetes API requests inside the cluster.\nkube-aws does not manage a DNS zone for the cluster.\nThis means that the deployer is responsible for ensuring the routability of the external DNS name to the public IP of the master node instance.\nThe certificate and key granted to the kube-apiserver.\nThis certificate will be presented to external clients of the Kubernetes cluster, so it should be valid for external DNS names, if necessary.\nAdditionally, the certificate must have the following Subject Alternative Names (SANs).\nThese IPs and DNS names are used within the cluster to route from applications to the Kubernetes API:\n\n127.0.0.1\n10.0.0.50\n10.3.0.1\nkubernetes\nkubernetes.default\nkubernetes.default.svc\nkubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local\n\n\n\n\nWorkerCert, WorkerKey\nThe certificate and key granted to the kubelets on worker instances.\nThe certificate is shared across all workers, so it must be valid for all worker hostnames.\nThis is achievable with the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) *.*.compute.internal, or *.ec2.internal if using the us-east-1 AWS region.\n\nCACert\nThe certificate authority's TLS certificate is used to sign other certificates in the cluster.\nThese assets are stored unencrypted in your credentials folder, but are encyrpted using Amazon KMS before being embedded in the CloudFormation template.\nAll keys and certs must be PEM-formatted and base64-encoded.\n\n\nRender and validate cluster assets\nAfter you have completed your customizations, re-render your assets with the new settings:\n$ kube-aws render credentials\n$ kube-aws render stack\n\nThe validate command check the validity of your changes to the cloud-config userdata files and the CloudFormation stack description.\nThis is an important step to make sure your stack will launch successfully:\n$ kube-aws validate\n\nIf your files are valid, you are ready to launch your cluster.\n"},"getting-started/step-3-launch.html":{"url":"getting-started/step-3-launch.html","title":"Step 3: Launch","keywords":"","body":"Launch your Kubernetes cluster on AWS\nThis is the third step of running Kubernetes on AWS. We're ready to launch the Kubernetes cluster.\nCreate the instances defined in the CloudFormation template\nNow for the exciting part, creating your cluster:\n$ kube-aws up\n\nNOTE: It can take some time after kube-aws up completes before the cluster is available. When the cluster is first being launched, it must download all container images for the cluster components (Kubernetes, dns, heapster, etc). Depending on the speed of your connection, it can take a few minutes before the Kubernetes api-server is available.\nConfigure DNS\nIf you configured Route 53 settings in your configuration above via createRecordSet, a host record has already been created for you.\nOtherwise, navigate to the DNS registrar hosting the zone for the provided external DNS name. Ensure a single A record exists, routing the value of externalDNSName defined in cluster.yaml to the externally-accessible IP of the master node instance.\nYou can invoke kube-aws status to get the cluster API endpoint after cluster creation, if necessary. This command can take a while.\nAccess the cluster\nA kubectl config file will be written to a kubeconfig file, which can be used to interact with your Kubernetes cluster like so:\n$ kubectl --kubeconfig=kubeconfig get nodes\n\nIf the container images are still downloading and/or the API server isn't accessible yet, the kubectl command above may show output similar to:\nThe connection to the server :443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?\nWait a few more minutes for everything to complete.\nOnce the API server is running, you should see:\n$ kubectl --kubeconfig=kubeconfig get nodes\nNAME                                       STATUS                     AGE\nip-10-0-0-xxx.us-west-1.compute.internal   Ready                      5m\nip-10-0-0-xxx.us-west-1.compute.internal   Ready                      5m\nip-10-0-0-xx.us-west-1.compute.internal    Ready,SchedulingDisabled   5m\n\n\n  You're all done!

Deleting the said secrets will solve the issue (see https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kube-aws/issues/1057).\nThe etcd caveat\nThere is no solution for hosting an etcd cluster in a way that is easily updateable in this fashion- so updates are automatically masked for the etcd instances. This means that, after the cluster is created, nothing about the etcd ec2 instances is allowed to be updated.\nFortunately, CoreOS update engine will take care of keeping the members of the etcd cluster up-to-date, but you as the operator will not be able to modify them after creation via the update mechanism.\nIn the (near) future, etcd will be hosted on Kubernetes and this problem will no longer be relevant. Rather than concocting overly complex band-aid, we've decided to \"punt\" on this issue of the time being.\nOnce you have successfully updated your cluster, you are ready to add node pools to your cluster.\n"},"getting-started/step-5-add-node-pool.html":{"url":"getting-started/step-5-add-node-pool.html","title":"Step 5: Add Node Pool","keywords":"","body":"Node Pool\nNode Pool allows you to bring up additional pools of worker nodes each with a separate configuration including:\n\nInstance Type\nStorage Type/Size/IOPS\nInstance Profile\nAdditional, User-Provided Security Group(s)\nSpot Price\nAWS service to manage your EC2 instances: Auto Scaling or Spot Fleet\nNode labels\nTaints\n\nDeploying a Multi-AZ cluster with cluster-autoscaler support with Node Pools\nkube-aws creates a node pool in a single AZ by default.\nOn top of that, you can add one or more node pool in an another AZ to achieve Multi-AZ.\nAssuming you already have a subnet and a node pool in the subnet:\nsubnets:\n- name: managedPublicSubnetIn1a\n  availabilityZone: us-west-1a\n  instanceCIDR: 10.0.0.0/24\n\nworker:\n  nodePools:\n    - name: pool1\n      subnets:\n      - name: managedPublicSubnetIn1a\n\nEdit the cluster.yaml file to add the second node pool:\nsubnets:\n- name: managedPublicSubnetIn1a\n  availabilityZone: us-west-1a\n  instanceCIDR: 10.0.0.0/24\n- name: managedPublicSubnetIn1c\n  availabilityZone: us-west-1c\n  instanceCIDR: 10.0.1.0/24\n\nworker:\n  nodePools:\n    - name: pool1\n      subnets:\n      - name: managedPublicSubnetIn1a\n    - name: pool2\n      subnets:\n      - name: managedPublicSubnetIn1c\n\nLaunch the secondary node pool by running kube-aws update:\n$ kube-aws update\nBeware that you have to associate only 1 AZ to a node pool or cluster-autoscaler may end up failing to reliably add nodes on demand due to the fact\nthat what cluster-autoscaler does is to increase/decrease the desired capacity hence it has no way to selectively add node(s) in a desired AZ.\nAlso note that deployment of cluster-autoscaler is currently out of scope of this documentation.\nPlease read cluster-autoscaler's documentation for instructions on it.\nCustomizing min/max size of the auto scaling group\nIf you've chosen to power your worker nodes in a node pool with an auto scaling group, you can customize MinSize, MaxSize, RollingUpdateMinInstancesInService in cluster.yaml:\nPlease read the AWS documentation for more information on MinSize, MaxSize, MinInstancesInService for ASGs.\nworker:\n  nodePools:\n  - name: pool1\n    autoScalingGroup:\n      minSize: 1\n      maxSize: 3\n      rollingUpdateMinInstancesInService: 2\n\nSee the detailed comments in cluster.yaml for further information.\nDeploying a node pool powered by Spot Fleet\nUtilizing Spot Fleet gives us chances to dramatically reduce cost being spent on EC2 instances powering Kubernetes worker nodes while achieving reasonable availability.\nAWS says cost reduction is up to 90% but the cost would slightly vary among instance types and other users' bids.\nSpot Fleet support may change in backward-incompatible ways as it is still an experimental feature.\nSo, please use this feature at your own risk.\nHowever, we'd greatly appreciate your feedbacks because they do accelerate improvements in this area!\nKnown Limitations\n\nRunning kube-aws update to increase or decrease targetCapacity of a spot fleet results in a complete replacement of the Spot Fleet hence some downtime. This is due to how CloudFormation works for updating a Spot Fleet\nIt is recommended to temporarily bring up an another, spare node pool to maintain the whole cluster capacity at a certain level while replacing the spot fleet.\n\n\n\nPre-requisites\nThis feature assumes you already have the IAM role with ARN like \"arn:aws:iam::youraccountid:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-role\" in your own AWS account.\nIt implies that you've arrived \"Spot Requests\" in EC2 Dashboard in the AWS console at least once.\nSee the AWS documentation describing pre-requisites for Spot Fleet for details.\nSteps\nTo add a node pool powered by Spot Fleet, edit node pool's cluster.yaml:\nworker:\n  nodePools:\n  - name: pool1\n    spotFleet:\n      targetCapacity: 3\n\nTo customize your launch specifications to diversify your pool among instance types other than the defaults, edit cluster.yaml:\nworker:\n  nodePools:\n  - name: pool1\n    spotFleet:\n      targetCapacity: 5\n      launchSpecifications:\n      - weightedCapacity: 1\n        instanceType: t2.medium\n      - weightedCapacity: 2\n        instanceType: m3.large\n      - weightedCapacity: 2\n        instanceType: m4.large\n\nThis configuration would normally result in Spot Fleet to bring up 3 instances to meet your target capacity:\n\n1x t2.medium = 1 capacity\n1x m3.large = 2 capacity\n1x m4.large = 2 capacity\n\nThis is achieved by the diversified strategy of Spot Fleet.\nPlease read the AWS documentation describing Spot Fleet Allocation Strategy for more details.\nPlease also see the detailed comments in cluster.yaml and the GitHub issue summarizing the initial implementation of this feature for further information.\nYou can optionally configure various Kubernetes add-ons according to your requirements.\nWhen you are done with your cluster, destroy your cluster\n"},"getting-started/step-6-configure-add-ons.html":{"url":"getting-started/step-6-configure-add-ons.html","title":"Step 6: Configure Add-ons","keywords":"","body":"Configuring Kubernetes Add-ons\nkube-aws has built-in supports for several Kubernetes add-ons known to require additional configurations beforehand.\ncluster-autoscaler\ncluster-autoscaler is an add-on which automatically\nscales in/out your k8s cluster by removing/adding worker nodes according to resource utilization per node.\nTo enable cluster-autoscaler, add the below settings to your cluster.yaml:\naddons:\n  clusterAutoscaler:\n    enabled: true\nworker:\n  nodePools:\n  -

do\n  ssh -i path/to/your/key core@$h sudo systemctl stop etcd-member.service\ndone\n\nand then sart the etcd3 process:\nfor h in $hosts; do\n  ssh -i path/to/your/key core@$h sudo systemctl start etcd-member.service\ndone\n\nDoing this triggers the automated disaster recovery processes across etcd nodes by running etcdadm-reconfigure.service\nand your cluster will eventually be restored from the snapshot stored at s3:///...//exported/etcd-snapshots/snapshot.db.\nAutomatic recovery\nA feature to automatically restore a permanently failed etcd member or a cluster can be enabled by specifying:\netcd:\n  disasterRecovery:\n    automated: true\n\nWhen enabled,\n\nThe command etcdadm check is called periodically by a systemd timer\nThe etcd cluster and each etcd node(=member) is checked by running etcdctl endpoint health command\n\n\nWhen up to 1/N etcd nodes failed successive health checks, it will be removed as an etcd member and then added again as a new member\nThe new member eventually catches up data from the etcd cluster\n\n\nWhen more than 1/N etcd nodes failed successive health checks, a disaster recovery process is executed to recover all the etcd nodes from the latest etcd snapshot\n\n"},"advanced-topics/kubernetes-dashboard.html":{"url":"advanced-topics/kubernetes-dashboard.html","title":"Kubernetes Dashboard Access","keywords":"","body":"Kubernetes Dashboard Access and Authentication\nDefault Setup\nkubernetesDashboard:\n  adminPrivileges: true\n  insecureLogin: false\n  enabled: true\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      cpu: 100m\n      memory: 100Mi\n    limits:\n      cpu: 100m\n      memory: 100Mi\n\nIn the default setup the Dashboard is configured using the --auto-generate-certificates flag only and has Admin privileges.\nEven if adminPrivileges is set to true, you'll be prompted to authenticate using kubeconfig or a token.\nIn this case you can use the Skip option on login page to access Dashboard.\nTo not deploy the dashboard and the manifests associated with it change enabled to \"false\"\nAccess the dashboard  using kubectl proxy command:\ninsecureLogin: false\n\nhttp://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/\ninsecureLogin: true\n\nhttp://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/\nNOTE:\n\nThe shortcut http://localhost:8001/ui is deprecated.
